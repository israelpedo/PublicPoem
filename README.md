# PublicPoem
This is a personal project where I put everything I learned into practice:
- Use promises to handle asynchronous operations, such as reading files, effectively.
- Simplify asynchronous code by using the async and await keywords to wait for promises to resolve.
- Use the FileReader object to read the contents of image files asynchronously.
- Handle errors in asynchronous operations using try/catch in asynchronous functions.
- Use asynchronous functions, async/await and Promises to perform asynchronous checks before adding tags.
- Check the validity of a tag asynchronously before adding it to the list, using JavaScript.
- Use try...catch to catch and handle errors during asynchronous operations.
- Simulate the publication of a project, capturing form data and using a function that randomly returns success or error.
- Use async/await to manage the execution of asynchronous functions, allowing code to wait for the publish function to complete.
